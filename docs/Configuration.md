# Configuration

log4rs can be configured programmatically by using the builders in the `config`
module to construct a log4rs `Config` object, which can be passed to the
`init_config` function.

The more common configuration method, however, is via a separate config file.
The `init_file` function takes the path to a config file as well as a
`Deserializers` object which is responsible for instantiating the various
objects specified by the config file. The following section covers the exact
configuration syntax. Examples of both the programatic and configuration files
can be found in the
[examples directory](https://github.com/estk/log4rs/tree/main/examples).

## Common Fields

### LevelFilter's

- Off
- Error
- Warn
- Info
- Debug
- Trace

### Filters

The only accepted `filter` is of kind threshold with a level. The level must
be a [LevelFilter](#levelfilters). One to many filters are allowed.

i.e.

```yml
filters:
  - kind: threshold
    level: info
```

### Encoder

An `encoder` consists of a kind: the default which is pattern, or json. If
pattern is defined, the default pattern `{d} {l} {t} - {m}{n}` is used unless
overridden. Refer to
[this documentation](https://docs.rs/log4rs/latest/log4rs/encode/pattern/index.html#formatters)
for details regarding valid patterns.

> Note that the json encoder does not have any additional controls such as the
> pattern field.

i.e.

```yml
encoder:
  kind: pattern
  pattern: "{h({d(%+)(utc)} [{f}:{L}] {l:<6} {M}:{m})}{n}"
```

## Loggers

A map of logger configurations.

### Logger Configuration

The _name_ of the logger is the yml tag.

The _level_ of the logger is optional and defaults to the parents log level.
The level must be a [LevelFilter](#levelfilters).

The _appenders_ field is an optional list of [appenders](#appenders) attached
to the logger.

The _additive_ field is an optional boolean determining if the loggers parent
will also be attached to this logger. The default is true.

i.e.

```yml
loggers:
  my_logger:
    level: info
    appenders:
      - my_appender
    additive: true
```

## The Root Logger

Root is the required logger. It is the parent to all children loggers. To
configure the Root, refer to [the logger section](#logger-configuration).

> Note: The root logger has no parent and therefore cannot the _additive_
field does not apply.

```yml
root:
  level: info
  appenders:
    - my_appender
```

## Appenders

All appenders require a unique identifying string for each
[appender configuration](#appender-config).

### Appender Config

Each Appender Kind has it's own configuration. However, all accept
[filters](#filters). The `kind` field is required in an appender configuration.

#### The Console Appender

The _target_ field is optional and accepts `stdout` or `stderr`. It's default
value is stdout.

The _tty_only_ field is an optional boolean and dictates that the appender must
only write when the target is a TTY. It's default value is false.

The _encoder_ field is optional and can consist of multiple fields. Refer to
the [encoder](#encoder) documention.

```yml
my_console_appender:
  kind: console
  target: stdout
  tty_only: false
```

#### The File Appender

The _path_ field is required and accepts environment variables of the form
`$ENV{name_here}`. The path can be relative or absolute.

The _encoder_ field is optional and can consist of multiple fields. Refer to
the [encoder](#encoder) documention.

The _append_ field is an optional boolean and defaults to `true`. True will
append to the log file if it exists, false will truncate the existing file.

```yml
my_file_appender:
  kind: file
  path: $ENV{PWD}/log/test.log
  append: true
```

#### The Rolling File Appender

The rolling file configuration is by far the most complex. Like the
[file appender](#the-file-appender), the path to the log file is required
with the _append_ and the _encoders_ optional fields.

i.e.

```yml
my_rolling_appender:
  kind: rolling_file
  path: "logs/test.log"
  policy:
    kind: compound
    trigger:
      kind: size
      limit: 1mb
    roller:
      kind: fixed_window
      base: 1
      count: 5
      pattern: "logs/test.{}.log"
```

The new component is the _policy_ field. A policy must have `kind` like most
other components, the default (and only supported) policy is `kind: compound`.

The _trigger_ field is used to dictate when the log file should be rolled. The
only supported trigger is  `kind: size`. There is a required field `limit`
which defines the maximum file size prior to a rolling of the file. The limit
field requires one of the following units in bytes, case does not matter:

- b
- kb/kib
- mb/mib
- gb/gib
- tb/tib

i.e.

```yml
trigger:
  kind: size
  limit: 10 mb
```

The _roller_ field supports two types: delete, and fixed_window. The delete
roller does not take any other configuration fields. The fixed_window roller
supports three fields: pattern, base, and count. The most current log file will
always have the _base_ index.

The _pattern_ field is used to rename files. The pattern must contain the
double curly brace `{}`. For example `archive/foo.{}.log`. Each instance of
`{}` will be replaced with the index number of the configuration file. Note
that if the file extension of the pattern is `.gz` and the `gzip` Cargo
feature is enabled, the archive files will be gzip-compressed.

> Note: This pattern field is only used for archived files. The `path` field
of the higher level `rolling_file` will be used for the active log file.

The _base_ field is the starting index used to name rolling files.

The _count_ field is the exclusive maximum index used to name rolling files.
However, be warned that the roller renames every file when a log rolls over.
Having a large count value can negatively impact performance.

i.e.

```yml
roller:
  kind: fixed_window
  base: 1
  count: 5
  pattern: "archive/journey-service.{}.log"
```

or

```yml
roller:
  kind: delete
```

## Refresh Rate

The _refresh_rate_ accepts a u64 value in seconds. The field is used to
determine how often log4rs will scan the configuration file for changes. If a
change is discovered, the logger will reconfigure automatically.

i.e.

```yml
refresh_rate: 30 seconds
```
